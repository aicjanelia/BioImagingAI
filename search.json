Discuss that there are many types of microscopy images and each will have their own AI considerations (e.g., imaging modality, 2D vs 3D, static vs time lapse).\nUse markdown heading level two for section headers.

That way, we will not need to handle a global environment across the book.",

One example that you might find interesting is the option to include callouts in your text. These callouts can be used to highlight potential pitfalls or provide additional optional exercises that the reader might find helpful. Below are examples of the types of callouts available in Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, tip, warning, caution, and important.
