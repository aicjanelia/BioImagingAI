We’ll discuss both general-purpose and microscopy-specific tools while highlighting practical applications and potential pitfalls.\nThis section introduces the fundamental concepts behind modern language models, focusing on transformer architectures that power tools like ChatGPT. We’ll explain how these models function, their capabilities for understanding scientific text, and their emerging role in generating code for image analysis tasks. We’ll demonstrate how microscopists can effectively use LLMs to learn new concepts, troubleshoot methods, and generate starting points for analysis scripts.\nMoving beyond text-only interfaces, multi-modal models combine language understanding with visual processing capabilities. This section explores how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4o can “see” and interpret microscopy images, assist with image annotation, and even aid in experimental design.

Use the eval: false option for this.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\n\nFigures can also be generated that do not show the code by using the option for code-fold: true.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: A spiral on a polar axis\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example equation.\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\n\n11.4.1 Embedding Figures\nYou can also embed figures from other notebooks in the repo as shown in the following embed example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Polar plot of circles of random areas at random coords\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen embedding notebooks, please store the .ipynb file in the notebook directory. Include the chapter in the name of your file. For example, chapter4_example_u-net.ipynb. This is how we will handle chapter- or example-specific environments. We will host notebooks on Google Colab so that any required packages for the code–but not for rendering the book at large–will be installed there. That way, we will not need to handle a global environment across the book.",

    "text": "11.5 Quarto has additional features.\nYou can learn more about markdown options and additional Quarto features in the Quarto documentation. One example that you might find interesting is the option to include callouts in your text. These callouts can be used to highlight potential pitfalls or provide additional optional exercises that the reader might find helpful. Below are examples of the types of callouts available in Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, tip, warning, caution, and important. They can default to open (like this example) or collapsed (example below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThese could be good for extra material or exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere are caveats when applying these tools. Expand the code below to learn more.\n\n\nCode\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe careful to avoid hallucinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis is key information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
