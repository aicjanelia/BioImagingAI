Hallucinations: |
  Outputs from a model that do not have a basis in the input data and may contain false or misleading information.

Training Data: |
  Data used to train an algorithm to make predictions.

Computer Vision: |
  A field of computer science wherein computers extract information from images. It often involves object detection within images and can involve classification of the images and/or objects.

Effect Size: |
  How "strong" a phenotype is, or how mathematically possible it is to distinguish a given population from the control population.

Ground Truth: |
  Accurate data against which a model can be evaluated. Ground truth data is often manually annotated. The data type itself will vary depending on the task and evaluation. e.g. instance segmentation may be compared to ground truth object counts or masks.

Instance Segmentation: |
  A computer vision technique that detects individual, specific objects within an image.

Metadata: |
  Any data that provides additional information about other data. In bioimaging, examples include information about sample preparation, the imaging instrument, and image acquisition parameters.

Panoptic Segmentation: |
  A computer vision technique that is a combination of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. It separates an image into regions while also detecting individual object instances within those regions.

Semantic Segmentation: |
  A computer vision technique that divides an image into classes.

Quality Control (Metric): |
  Any metric that can be used to evaluate quality. It will vary depending on the task and data type. It can be binary (e.g. an image doesn't have debris) or continuous (e.g. annotated object centroids are within 5 pixels of the ground truth centroids).
