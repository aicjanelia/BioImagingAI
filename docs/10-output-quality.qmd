subtitle: How to pick a model?

# Output Quality

Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 10 addresses how to assess the quality of a modelâ€™s output, mentioning Metrics Reloaded. This chapter should address the question: how do I know my model is good enough? It should frame this discussion using the example of a segmentation model and discuss how tools can identify uncertain decisions from a model.

* why do we need metrics? to pick models from different training iterations
  (avoid overfitting) and to select models with different hyperparameters
* mention train/validate/test

## Metrics and Losses

* difference between "metric" and "loss"

* loss:
  * has to be "differentiable"
  * used to train the network
  * should already be close to the metric you want to use
  * can be used to assess model quality on validation data (but a custom metric might be more insightful)

* metric:
  * an application specific measure of how close you are to the ground truth
  * used to select a model and to measure progress
  * does not need to be "differentiable"
  * but if it is, that's great, you can use it as a loss
  * otherwise, find a loss that is a good proxy or chose your model based on
    the metric on the validation dataset

## What Metric to Pick?

* ideally: metric reflects *time/cost needed to clean up* for a *particular application*
* this can mean different things, and sometimes there is no single number (see Cell Tracking below)

## Examples

### Segmentation Metrics

* show on examples:
  * dice
  * Hausdorff
  * AP_x (and required matching)
* mention MetricsReloaded

### Cell Tracking Metrics

* usually not a single number: topological correctness vs. positional correctness
* show traccuracy and discuss some of their metrics
